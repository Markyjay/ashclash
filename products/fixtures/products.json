There are also strategically placed air vents for improved air circulation.\r\n\r\nLightweight.\r\nOne of the most lightweight helmets on the market while at the same time preserving the elite level of protection that it provides. Everything from the thickness of the shell and foam lining to the metal and fabric used for the adjustment clips have been modified and laboured over to deliver the most lightweight and efficient hurling helmet ever made.\r\n\r\nDual-density foam line.\r\nThrough a process called “Dampening” our specially formulated Dual-Density foam inner lining efficiently disrupts and disperses the energy from the force of an impact by decreasing the amplitude of the shock wave that has managed to penetrate the high density PE outer shell.\r\n\r\nMaximum Faceguard vision.\r\nThe ATAK faceguard offers the maximum field of vision possible while still remaining within the IS355 safety regulations.\r\n\r\nSupreme Comfort.\r\nSoft latex foam padding and chin piece provides a comfort fit that holds the helmet to the head and neutralises all movement of the helmet around the head. This reduces friction and ensures that the field of vision of the faceguard remains the same.",

The early years were characterised with huge underage success most notably National Feile success and Minor football & hurling championship finals.  Adult success soon followed with Junior and Intermediate football and hurling league and championship wins with the result that we competed at Senior level across both hurling and football for many years.\r\n\r\nEqually, we have enjoyed camogie success culminating in many county championship and league titles. Our ladies football section has expanded in recent years and has teams across all ages from juvenile through to adult.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, we moved to our new grounds in Drumnigh, which offers us an amazing facility with 2 adult and training pitches, hurling wall and dressing room facilities.\r\n\r\nThe club has produced many players down through the generations that have gone on  to represent Dublin on the national stage. Most famous of these is Vinny Murphy who won an All Star in 1992 and went on to win All Ireland in 1995 with the Dublin footballers.\r\n\r\nLike any GAA club, Trinity Gaels ambition is to give our players the very best opportunity to enjoy our games. All our volunteers, coaches and helpers provide a platform to learn the skills and discipline of our games. The comradeship, friendships and community spirit engendered by everyone involved has ensured a healthy community for all to grow and live in.",

      "description": "DESCRIPTION\r\nHigh-Density PE Shell.\r\nA high-density PE shell that has functionally designed 3 panel geometry with multiple ridges for an increased surface area to displace and deflect impacts. There are also strategically placed air vents for improved air circulation.\r\n\r\nLightweight.\r\nOne of the most lightweight helmets on the market while at the same time preserving the elite level of protection that it provides. Everything from the thickness of the shell and foam lining to the metal and fabric used for the adjustment clips have been modified and laboured over to deliver the most lightweight and efficient hurling helmet ever made.\r\n\r\nDual-density foam line.\r\nThrough a process called “Dampening” our specially formulated Dual-Density foam inner lining efficiently disrupts and disperses the energy from the force of an impact by decreasing the amplitude of the shock wave that has managed to penetrate the high density PE outer shell.\r\n\r\nMaximum Faceguard vision.\r\nThe ATAK faceguard offers the maximum field of vision possible while still remaining within the IS355 safety regulations.\r\n\r\nSupreme Comfort.\r\nSoft latex foam padding and chin piece provides a comfort fit that holds the helmet to the head and neutralises all movement of the helmet around the head. This reduces friction and ensures that the field of vision of the faceguard remains the same.",
